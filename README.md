# Introduction to Graphical Models and Inference for Communications

Teaching material used for the course [Advanced Communications](https://aplicaciones.uc3m.es/cpa/generaFicha?est=278&asig=15028&idioma=2) which is offered within the Master in Multimedia & Communications at [University Carlos III in Madrid (Spain)](https://www.uc3m.es/Home). 

The introduction to graphical models and inference for communications is structured in eight lessons:
1. Introduction to Graphical Models and Inference for Communications
2. Exact Inference in Discrete cycle-free Factor Graphs. Belief Propagation.
3. Inference Discrete Factor Graphs with cycles. Loopy Belief Progataion.
4. Gaussian message passing.
5. The max-product algorithm.
6. LDPC codes over the Binary Erasure Channel.
7. LDPC codes over general channels.
8. Turbo-codes.

We provide the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) source code for the slides used in each of the lecture. This material has been created by
